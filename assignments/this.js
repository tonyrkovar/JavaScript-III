/* The four principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. window binding 
    I think of window binding as the "global" for the this function. If you were to run it w/o 'strict' you would end up pulling 'this' for the browser which pulls all of JS. 
* 2. implicit binding
    implicit binding is when you're using . this to target a specific item. implicate.this
* 3. new binding
    new binding allows constructor functions to work properly when you're using the new binding you're capable of creating a whole
    new object by inputing the parameters that are parsed with this._parameter name_
* 4. explicit binding
    explicit binding is when you use the object methods associated with 'this' (call() apply() bind())
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
